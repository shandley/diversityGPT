## Introduction

One of the most powerful features of diversityGPT is the ability to identify which specific taxa serve as indicators of the different information components (R, E, P, S) in diversity patterns. This vignette demonstrates how to use the taxa indicator analysis to gain biological insights into your microbiome data.

**Note**: Version 2.0+ introduces the revolutionary `robust_taxa_indicators()` function that combines multiple mathematical approaches for the most rigorous analysis. See the "Robust Taxa Indicator Analysis" vignette for advanced usage.

## Understanding Information Components

The universal information framework decomposes diversity into four components:

- **Richness (R)**: Information from the number of different taxa
- **Evenness (E)**: Information from the relative abundance distribution
- **Phylogenetic (P)**: Information from evolutionary relationships
- **Spatial (S)**: Information from spatial/environmental heterogeneity

## Basic Taxa Driver Analysis

Let's start with a simple example:

```{r basic-example}
# Create demo data with meaningful patterns
set.seed(123)
demo_data <- create_demo_phyloseq(n_samples = 20, n_taxa = 100)

# Extract universal information components
info <- extract_universal_information(demo_data)

# Identify taxa drivers
drivers <- identify_taxa_drivers(demo_data, 
                                 components = info,
                                 top_n = 10,
                                 method = "contribution")

# View the results
print(drivers)
```

## Understanding Driver Methods

The package offers three methods for identifying driver taxa:

### 1. Contribution Method (Default)

This method calculates how much each taxon contributes to the total information in each component:

```{r contribution-method}
drivers_contrib <- identify_taxa_drivers(demo_data,
                                        method = "contribution",
                                        top_n = 5,
                                        verbose = FALSE)

# Top richness drivers are taxa that are frequently present
head(drivers_contrib$richness_drivers[, c("taxon", "contribution", "presence_frequency")])
```

### 2. Variance Method

This method identifies taxa whose abundance variance drives changes in each component:

```{r variance-method}
drivers_var <- identify_taxa_drivers(demo_data,
                                    method = "variance", 
                                    top_n = 5,
                                    verbose = FALSE)

# High variance taxa drive spatial patterns
head(drivers_var$spatial_drivers[, c("taxon", "contribution", "dispersion_index")])
```

### 3. Correlation Method

This method finds taxa whose patterns correlate with each information component:

```{r correlation-method}
drivers_cor <- identify_taxa_drivers(demo_data,
                                    method = "correlation",
                                    top_n = 5,
                                    verbose = FALSE)

# Taxa correlated with evenness patterns
head(drivers_cor$evenness_drivers[, c("taxon", "contribution", "mean_relative_abundance")])
```

## Visualizing Taxa Drivers

### Bar Plot

Shows top driver taxa for each component:

```{r bar-plot, fig.height=8}
plot(drivers, type = "bar", top_n = 10)
```

### Network Visualization

Shows relationships between taxa and components:

```{r network-plot, fig.height=6}
plot(drivers, type = "network", top_n = 8, interactive = FALSE)
```

### Heatmap

Shows contribution patterns across all components:

```{r heatmap, fig.height=8}
plot(drivers, type = "heatmap", top_n = 15)
```

### Multi-Component Drivers

Identifies taxa that drive multiple components:

```{r contribution-plot}
plot(drivers, type = "contribution", top_n = 20)
```

## Biological Interpretation

### Richness Drivers

Taxa driving richness are typically:
- Core microbiome members (high presence frequency)
- Indicator species for specific conditions
- Taxa with broad environmental tolerance

```{r richness-interpretation}
# Examine richness drivers in detail
richness_drivers <- drivers$richness_drivers
cat("Top 3 richness drivers:\n")
for (i in 1:3) {
  cat(sprintf("  %s: %.1f%% presence, %.2f mean abundance\n",
              richness_drivers$taxon[i],
              richness_drivers$presence_frequency[i] * 100,
              richness_drivers$mean_abundance[i]))
}
```

### Evenness Drivers

Taxa driving evenness patterns are typically:
- Dominant species that reduce evenness
- Bloom-forming taxa
- Competitive dominants

```{r evenness-interpretation}
# Examine evenness drivers
evenness_drivers <- drivers$evenness_drivers
cat("\nTop 3 evenness drivers (dominance indicators):\n")
for (i in 1:3) {
  cat(sprintf("  %s: %.1f%% mean relative abundance, CV=%.2f\n",
              evenness_drivers$taxon[i],
              evenness_drivers$mean_relative_abundance[i] * 100,
              evenness_drivers$cv_relative_abundance[i]))
}
```

### Spatial Drivers

Taxa driving spatial patterns show:
- Patchy distributions
- Environmental specificity
- Dispersal limitation

```{r spatial-interpretation}
# Examine spatial drivers
spatial_drivers <- drivers$spatial_drivers
cat("\nTop 3 spatial drivers (patchy distribution):\n")
for (i in 1:3) {
  cat(sprintf("  %s: dispersion index=%.2f, occupancy=%.1f%%\n",
              spatial_drivers$taxon[i],
              spatial_drivers$dispersion_index[i],
              spatial_drivers$occupancy[i] * 100))
}
```

## Advanced Analysis with Groups

When you have experimental groups or environmental gradients:

```{r grouped-analysis}
# Add treatment groups to demo data
sample_data(demo_data)$Treatment <- rep(c("Control", "Treatment"), each = 10)

# Analyze with groups
drivers_grouped <- identify_taxa_drivers(demo_data,
                                        groups = "Treatment",
                                        method = "variance",
                                        top_n = 5,
                                        verbose = FALSE)

# Spatial drivers now reflect between-group differences
cat("Spatial drivers reflecting treatment effects:\n")
print(drivers_grouped$spatial_drivers[, c("taxon", "contribution")])
```

## Multi-Component Driver Analysis

Some taxa drive multiple information components:

```{r multi-drivers}
# Find taxa driving multiple components
summary_stats <- drivers$summary$overall

if (summary_stats$n_multi_component > 0) {
  cat("Taxa driving multiple components:\n")
  for (taxon in head(summary_stats$multi_component_drivers, 5)) {
    # Find which components this taxon drives
    components <- c()
    if (taxon %in% drivers$richness_drivers$taxon) components <- c(components, "R")
    if (taxon %in% drivers$evenness_drivers$taxon) components <- c(components, "E") 
    if (taxon %in% drivers$phylogenetic_drivers$taxon) components <- c(components, "P")
    if (taxon %in% drivers$spatial_drivers$taxon) components <- c(components, "S")
    
    cat(sprintf("  %s: drives %s\n", taxon, paste(components, collapse = ", ")))
  }
}
```

## Generating Reports

Create comprehensive HTML reports of your analysis:

```{r report, eval=FALSE}
# Generate HTML report
report_taxa_drivers(drivers, 
                   demo_data,
                   output_file = "taxa_drivers_report.html",
                   title = "Microbiome Taxa Driver Analysis")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Choose the right method**:
   - Use "contribution" for overall importance
   - Use "variance" for change drivers
   - Use "correlation" for pattern associations

2. **Normalize wisely**:
   - Normalize when comparing across components
   - Don't normalize when absolute contributions matter

3. **Consider sample size**:
   - More samples give more reliable driver identification
   - Bootstrap for confidence intervals with small samples

4. **Validate findings**:
   - Cross-reference with known biology
   - Confirm with targeted analyses
   - Use multiple methods for robustness

## Integration with Ecological Intelligence

Combine taxa drivers with AI interpretation:

```{r ai-integration, eval=FALSE}
# Configure LLM (requires API key)
configure_llm(provider = "openai", model = "gpt-4")

# Get ecological interpretation of drivers
interpretation <- interpret_diversity_patterns(
  drivers,
  study_context = list(
    environment = "human_gut",
    condition = "antibiotic_treatment"
  )
)

# Generate hypotheses about driver taxa
hypotheses <- generate_ecological_hypotheses(
  drivers,
  taxa_of_interest = drivers$richness_drivers$taxon[1:3]
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### No phylogenetic tree
If your data lacks a phylogenetic tree, the analysis will use taxonomic information:

```{r no-tree}
# Remove tree from demo data
demo_no_tree <- demo_data
phy_tree(demo_no_tree) <- NULL

# Still works using taxonomy
drivers_no_tree <- identify_taxa_drivers(demo_no_tree, 
                                        top_n = 5,
                                        verbose = FALSE)
print(drivers_no_tree$phylogenetic_drivers[1:3, c("taxon", "contribution")])
```

### Handling zeros
The methods handle zero-inflated data appropriately:

```{r zero-handling}
# Create sparse data
otu_sparse <- otu_table(demo_data)
otu_sparse[otu_sparse < 5] <- 0  # Make data sparse

demo_sparse <- phyloseq(otu_sparse, 
                        sample_data(demo_data),
                        tax_table(demo_data))

# Analysis still works
drivers_sparse <- identify_taxa_drivers(demo_sparse,
                                       top_n = 5,
                                       verbose = FALSE)
cat("Identified", nrow(drivers_sparse$richness_drivers), "richness drivers\n")
```

## Conclusion

Taxa driver analysis provides crucial biological insights by identifying which specific microbes contribute most to diversity patterns. This bridges the gap between mathematical decomposition and biological understanding, enabling targeted follow-up studies and hypothesis generation.

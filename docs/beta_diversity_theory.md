# Theoretical Framework: Beta Diversity Decomposition into R, E, P, S Components

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a theoretical framework for decomposing beta diversity (between-sample diversity) into universal information components: Richness (R), Evenness (E), Phylogenetic (P), and Spatial (S). This extends the revolutionary diversityGPT framework from alpha to beta diversity.

## Conceptual Foundation

### Current State: Alpha Diversity Decomposition
```
α_diversity = R_α + E_α + P_α + S_α
```

### Proposed: Beta Diversity Decomposition
```
β_diversity = R_β + E_β + P_β + S_β
```

## Mathematical Framework

### 1. R_β Component: Richness Turnover

**Definition**: The information content due to species identity differences between communities.

**Mathematical Formulation**:
```r
R_β(i,j) = H(X_i ∪ X_j) - 0.5 * [H(X_i) + H(X_j)]
```
Where:
- H(X) is the entropy of species presence/absence
- X_i, X_j are the species sets in samples i and j

**Operational Metrics**:
- Jaccard distance (presence/absence)
- Sørensen dissimilarity  
- Species turnover component of Baselga's framework

**Interpretation**: How much information is gained by knowing which species are unique to each sample.

### 2. E_β Component: Evenness Turnover

**Definition**: The information content due to differences in abundance distributions between communities.

**Mathematical Formulation**:
```r
E_β(i,j) = D_KL(P_i || P_avg) + D_KL(P_j || P_avg)
```
Where:
- D_KL is Kullback-Leibler divergence
- P_i, P_j are the relative abundance distributions
- P_avg is the average distribution

**Operational Metrics**:
- Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (abundance-weighted)
- Morisita-Horn index
- Abundance gradient component

**Interpretation**: How much the abundance patterns differ from what would be expected if both samples had the same distribution.

### 3. P_β Component: Phylogenetic Turnover

**Definition**: The information content due to evolutionary differences between communities.

**Mathematical Formulation**:
```r
P_β(i,j) = PhyloEntropy(X_i ∪ X_j) - 0.5 * [PhyloEntropy(X_i) + PhyloEntropy(X_j)]
```
Where:
- PhyloEntropy incorporates branch lengths on the phylogenetic tree

**Operational Metrics**:
- UniFrac (unweighted for presence/absence)
- Weighted UniFrac (abundance-weighted)
- Phylogenetic Sørensen index

**Interpretation**: The evolutionary distinctiveness of species unique to each community.

### 4. S_β Component: Spatial Turnover Structure

**Definition**: The information content explained by spatial configuration and distance.

**Mathematical Formulation**:
```r
S_β(i,j) = f(d_ij) * [1 - exp(-d_ij/λ)]
```
Where:
- d_ij is the spatial distance between samples
- λ is the spatial correlation length scale
- f() is a scaling function

**Operational Metrics**:
- Distance-decay relationships
- Mantel correlations
- Spatial autocorrelation components

**Interpretation**: How much of the dissimilarity is predictable from spatial separation.

## Unified Framework Properties

### 1. Additivity
The total beta diversity should equal the sum of components:
```r
β_total = R_β + E_β + P_β + S_β
```

### 2. Independence
Components should capture orthogonal aspects of variation:
- R_β: Which species differ
- E_β: How abundances differ  
- P_β: How evolutionarily distinct the differences are
- S_β: How spatially structured the differences are

### 3. Scale Invariance
Components should be normalized to [0,1] for comparability:
```r
β_normalized = (R_β + E_β + P_β + S_β) / 4
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Pairwise Beta Decomposition
```r
# For any two samples i, j
beta_components <- decompose_beta_diversity(
  sample_i, sample_j,
  tree = phylo_tree,
  coords = spatial_coords
)

# Returns:
# beta_components$R_beta  # Richness turnover
# beta_components$E_beta  # Evenness turnover  
# beta_components$P_beta  # Phylogenetic turnover
# beta_components$S_beta  # Spatial turnover
```

### Phase 2: Multi-Sample Beta Decomposition
```r
# For a full community matrix
beta_matrix <- decompose_beta_diversity_matrix(
  community_matrix,
  method = "centroid",  # or "pairwise_average"
  tree = phylo_tree,
  coords = spatial_coords
)

# Returns n x n x 4 array (samples x samples x components)
```

### Phase 3: Ordination in R-E-P-S Space
```r
# Novel ordination approach
beta_ordination <- beta_reps_pca(
  community_matrix,
  components = c("R", "E", "P", "S")
)

# Visualize which component drives sample separation
plot(beta_ordination, color_by = "dominant_component")
```

## Validation Framework

### 1. Reconstruction Test
Can we reconstruct traditional beta diversity metrics from R, E, P, S components?
```r
# Test: Bray-Curtis ≈ f(R_β, E_β)
# Test: UniFrac ≈ g(R_β, P_β)
# Test: Jaccard ≈ h(R_β)
```

### 2. Ecological Validity
Do components correspond to known ecological processes?
- R_β → Environmental filtering (species sorting)
- E_β → Competitive exclusion (dominance shifts)
- P_β → Phylogenetic clustering/overdispersion
- S_β → Dispersal limitation

### 3. Statistical Properties
- Components should be approximately orthogonal
- Should explain >90% of total beta diversity variation
- Should be robust to sampling effort

## Novel Applications

### 1. Beta Diversity Prediction
```r
# Predict unmeasured beta diversity metrics
predicted_unifrac <- predict_beta_metric(
  source_metric = "bray_curtis",
  target_metric = "unifrac",
  reps_decomposition = beta_components
)
```

### 2. Cross-Study Beta Comparison
```r
# Compare beta diversity patterns across studies using different metrics
study1_beta <- decompose_beta(study1_data)  # Used Bray-Curtis
study2_beta <- decompose_beta(study2_data)  # Used Jaccard
# Now directly comparable via R, E, P, S!
```

### 3. Mechanistic Hypothesis Testing
```r
# Test: Does pH gradient drive richness or evenness turnover?
model <- lm(R_beta ~ pH_difference + E_beta ~ pH_difference)
# Reveals which component responds to environmental gradient
```

## Integration with Alpha Diversity

### Multiplicative Relationship
```r
γ_diversity = α_diversity × β_diversity

# In R-E-P-S space:
γ_R = α_R × (1 + β_R)
γ_E = α_E × (1 + β_E)
γ_P = α_P × (1 + β_P)
γ_S = α_S × (1 + β_S)
```

### Partitioning Framework
```r
# Complete diversity partitioning
diversity_partition <- partition_diversity(
  community_matrix,
  levels = c("alpha", "beta", "gamma")
)

# Returns R, E, P, S components at each level
```

## Research Questions This Enables

1. **Which component of beta diversity responds to environmental gradients?**
   - Traditional: "Beta diversity changes with pH"
   - New: "Richness turnover (R_β) increases with pH difference, but evenness turnover (E_β) does not"

2. **Are community assembly mechanisms scale-dependent?**
   - Compare R, E, P, S ratios at alpha vs beta scales
   - Test if environmental filtering operates differently within vs between sites

3. **Can we predict functional beta diversity from taxonomic components?**
   - Model: Functional_β = f(R_β, E_β, P_β)
   - Identifies which taxonomic component drives functional turnover

4. **How do different disturbances affect beta diversity components?**
   - Fire might increase R_β (species turnover)
   - Nutrient pollution might increase E_β (evenness shifts)
   - Habitat fragmentation might increase S_β (spatial structure)

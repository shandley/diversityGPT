Description: Transforms microbiome diversity analysis through a revolutionary mathematical
    framework for universal metric transformation. Implements information theory-based
    deconvolution to convert between any diversity metrics (Shannon, Simpson, Chao1,
    Faith's PD, UniFrac, etc.) by decomposing them into fundamental components:
    Richness (R), Evenness (E), Phylogenetic (P), and Spatial (S). Features include
    AI-powered ecological interpretation, assembly mechanism detection, hypothesis
    generation, and interactive visualizations. Enables standardized cross-study
    comparisons and meta-analyses through metric harmonization. Integrates with
    'phyloseq' for seamless microbiome workflow integration.

Title: Universal Diversity Analysis with AI Ecological Intelligence
Version: 0.9.0.9000
Authors@R: c(
    person("Scott", "Handley", , "scott.handley@wustl.edu", role = c("aut", "cre")))
Description: Transforms microbiome diversity analysis through a revolutionary mathematical
    framework for universal metric transformation. Implements information theory-based
    deconvolution to convert between any diversity metrics (Shannon, Simpson, Chao1,
    Faith's PD, UniFrac, etc.) by decomposing them into fundamental components:
    Richness (R), Evenness (E), Phylogenetic (P), and Spatial (S). Features include
    AI-powered ecological interpretation, assembly mechanism detection, hypothesis
    generation, robust taxa indicator analysis combining null models, information theory,
    Shapley values, and bootstrap methods. Includes experimental beta diversity
    decomposition framework for between-sample analysis. Enables standardized cross-study
    comparisons and meta-analyses through metric harmonization. Provides interactive
    Shiny applications and integrates with 'phyloseq' for seamless workflow.

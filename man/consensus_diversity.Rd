\title{Consensus analysis across multiple diversity metrics}
\usage{
consensus_diversity(
  diversity_results,
  method = c("weighted_mean", "majority_vote", "correlation_weighted"),
  groups = NULL,
  alpha = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{diversity_results}{A diversity_results object from calculate_diversity()}

\item{method}{Character string specifying consensus method:
\itemize{
\item "weighted_mean": Weight by reliability (inverse of CV)
\item "majority_vote": Based on statistical significance patterns
\item "correlation_weighted": Weight by inter-metric correlation
}}

\item{groups}{Optional grouping variable for statistical comparisons}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for statistical tests (default 0.05)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item consensus_scores: Overall diversity scores per sample
\item method_weights: Weights assigned to each metric
\item conflict_analysis: Details about metric disagreements
\item interpretation: Summary of consensus patterns
}
}
\description{
This function resolves conflicts between different diversity metrics by
applying consensus algorithms. When Shannon diversity shows significance
but Simpson doesn't, this function helps determine the overall pattern.

\dontrun{
data(example_physeq)
div_results <- calculate_diversity(example_physeq, groups = "Group")
consensus <- consensus_diversity(div_results, groups = "Group")

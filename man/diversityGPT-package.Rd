\title{diversityGPT: Universal Diversity Analysis with AI-Powered Ecological Intelligence}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

Transforms microbiome diversity analysis through a revolutionary mathematical framework for universal metric transformation. Implements information theory-based deconvolution to convert between any diversity metrics (Shannon, Simpson, Chao1, Faith's PD, UniFrac, etc.) by decomposing them into fundamental components: Richness (R), Evenness (E), Phylogenetic (P), and Spatial (S). Features include AI-powered ecological interpretation, assembly mechanism detection, hypothesis generation, and interactive visualizations. Enables standardized cross-study comparisons and meta-analyses through metric harmonization. Integrates with 'phyloseq' for seamless microbiome workflow integration.
